                    turned into a weapon by which they would destroy Io. Kaasma

                    period of time, returning to lay waste to Io after hunting
                    down Elenora Mordove and her friends. The threat of Kaasma
                    Khara is the predominant conflict in Act 2 of Phase 2 and is
                    a central focus of the Astral Academy, Goblins of Io and
